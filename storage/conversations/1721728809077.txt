It involved many of the world's leading countries, which were split into two opposing alliances: the Allies (France, Russia, UK, Italy, Japan, and the United States) and the Central Powers (Germany, Austria-Hungary, Ottoman Empire and Bulgaria).\n\nThe war began after the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria-Hungary by a Serbian nationalist, which led Austria-Hungary to declare war on Serbia. The conflict escalated as allies of both sides joined the fight. \n\nWorld War I was marked by its trench warfare, where soldiers fought from fortified ditches rather than on an open battlefield. It also saw the first use of chemical weapons and tanks. \n\nThe war ended with the signing of the Armistice on November 11, 1918. The Treaty of Versailles signed in 1919 officially ended the state of war between Germany and the Allies. The war resulted in heavy casualties with an estimated 8.5 million soldiers killed and 21 million wounded. It also caused significant changes in the political landscape, leading to the fall of several empires and the beginning of many new countries.\n  \nWorld War I is also known for setting the stage for World War II, as the harsh reparations and economic instability imposed on Germany by the Treaty of Versailles contributed to the rise of Adolf Hitler and the Nazi Party."}]
