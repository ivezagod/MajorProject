It involved many of the world's then leading powers which were organized into two opposing military alliances: the Allies (primarily France, Russia, and the United Kingdom) and the Central Powers (primarily Germany, Austria-Hungary, and Turkey). The war was characterized by trench warfare, new military technologies, and unprecedented levels of casualties.\n\nWorld War I has significant relevance to real-world situations and other fields of study. For instance, its effects shaped geopolitical dynamics, leading to the redrawing of national boundaries and the emergence of new states. It also resulted in significant social change, affected arts and literature, and influenced economic and political ideologies. The war's impact on health, psychology, and technology are still subjects of academic research.\n\nCommon misconceptions about World War I include the belief that it was an unavoidable war or that it was solely a European conflict. Some may also underestimate the impact it had on the home fronts, including the roles women played and the societal changes it induced. The war was not just fought in the trenches; it was also a war of economies and home fronts.\n\nFor reliable resources about World War I, you may visit the British Library's World War One resource site, the BBC's World War One site, and the National Archives' collection on World War One.
