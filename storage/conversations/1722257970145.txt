It is one of the deadliest conflicts in history.<\/li>\n<li>Major causes include nationalism, militarism, imperialism, and the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria-Hungary.<\/li>\n<li>The war was largely fought in trenches on the Western Front within Europe.<\/li>\n<li>Key players included the Allies (mainly France, Russia, and the United Kingdom) and the Central Powers (mainly Germany, Austria-Hungary, and the Ottoman Empire).<\/li>\n<li>The United States joined the war in 1917, aiding in the eventual victory of the Allies.<\/li>\n<li>The Treaty of Versailles officially ended the war in 1919, punishing Germany with heavy war reparations and territorial loss. This would later contribute to the start of World War II.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/div>\n\n<div style=\"background-color:#F4D03F; color:#283747; padding:20px\">\n<h1 class=\"text-2xl font-bold pb-5\">World War 1 in Real-world Situations and Other Fields of Study<\/h1>\n<ul>\n<li>In Political Science, World War 1 is studied to understand the balance of power, alliances, and the impact of militarism and nationalism.<\/li>\n<li>In Sociology, it is used to study the social and cultural effects of war, such as the change in gender roles, as women had to take up jobs vacated by men going to war.<\/li>\n<li>In Literature, many works are inspired by or directly reference World War 1, reflecting the psychological trauma and social changes brought about by the war.<\/li>\n<li>The modern world's geopolitical landscape has been significantly shaped by the outcomes of World War 1, such as the creation of new countries and the rise of political ideologies.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/div>\n\n<div style=\"background-color:#58D68D; color:#283747; padding:20px\">\n<h1 class=\"text-2xl font-bold pb-5\">Common Misconceptions or Challenges Associated with Understanding World War 1<\/h1>\n<ul>\n<li>A common misconception is that World War 1 was only fought in Europe.

In fact, they joined only in 1917, three years after the war started.<\/li>\n<li>Understanding the complex political alliances and causes can be a challenge for many.
