Key Concepts and Important Aspects of World War 1<\/h2>\n  <p>\n    <!--answer-->\n    - **Causes of the war**: The main cause of World War 1 was the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria-Hungary. However, there were many underlying causes such as militarism, alliances, imperialism, and nationalism.\n    <br>\n    - **Major Powers Involved**: The two main sides were the Allies (including the UK, Russia, France, and later the US) and the Central Powers (Germany, Austria-Hungary, Ottoman Empire, and Bulgaria).\n    <br>\n    - **Trench Warfare**: This was a significant aspect of World War 1 where opposing troops fought from trenches facing each other.\n    <br>\n    - **Impact of technology on warfare**: The war saw the use of new technologies like machine guns, tanks, and chemical weapons.\n    <br>\n    - **Outcome and Consequences**: The war resulted in significant geopolitical changes, including the Treaty of Versailles and the foundation of the League of Nations.\n  <\/p>\n<\/div>\n\n<div>\n  <h2>2.
