It involved many of the world's leading powers which were divided into two opposing alliances, the Allies (comprising France, Russia, and the United Kingdom) and the Central Powers (primarily Germany, Austria-Hungary, and the Ottoman Empire). The war was triggered by the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria in June 1914.\n\nOne of the most significant aspects of World War 1 was the extensive use of trench warfare and chemical weapons, leading to massive casualties. The war also marked the end of four monarchies: Germany, Austria-Hungary, Russia, and the Ottoman Empire. The Treaty of Versailles, signed in 1919, officially ended the war and had profound effects on the geopolitical landscape, leading to the redrawing of borders and the creation of numerous new states.\n\nWorld War 1 has many connections to real-world situations and other fields of study. In political science and history, it is often studied for its role in reshaping the world order and setting the stage for World War 2. In sociology, the war's impact on society and culture, particularly the role of women and the emergence of new artistic movements in response to the war, is examined. \n\nOne common misconception about World War 1 is that it was primarily fought in trenches. While trench warfare was a significant aspect of the Western Front, many other forms of warfare were used, including naval and aerial combat. Another challenge in understanding World War 1 is the complex system of alliances and the multiple causes that led to the outbreak of war.\n\nTo deepen your understanding, you might consider asking: How did World War 1 change the geopolitical landscape? How did it impact civilian populations? What were the long-term effects of chemical weapons? What role did colonial troops play in the war?\n\nFor reliable online resources, you can refer to the following:\n\n1.
