It was marked by several important aspects such as the use of trench warfare, introduction of new weapons like tanks and airplanes, and the involvement of many nations around the world. The conflict was driven by a complex web of alliances, rivalries, and tensions between the major powers, which could be heated up by a single event like the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria. \n\nWorld War 1 has a lot of relevance to real-world situations and other fields of study. For instance, it provides a historical context for the study of international relations, politics, economics, and even engineering and technology due to the advancements in weaponry and machinery during this period.
