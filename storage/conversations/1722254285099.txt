The immediate cause was the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria-Hungary in June 1914 by a Serbian nationalist.\n\nThis war pitted two major alliances against each other: the Central Powers (mainly Germany, Austria-Hungary, and Turkey) and the Allied Powers (mainly France, Britain, Russia, Italy, Japan, and, from 1917, the United States). It was one of the deadliest conflicts in history, with an estimated 9 million combatant deaths and 13 million civilian deaths as a direct result of the war. \n\nThe war marked the end of four empires: the German, Austro-Hungarian, Russian, and Ottoman empires. It also led to significant political changes, including revolutions in many of the nations involved. The Treaty of Versailles, signed in 1919, officially ended the state of war between Germany and the Allied Powers. It imposed heavy reparations and territorial losses on Germany, factors which contributed to the outbreak of World War II two decades later. \n\nWorld War I also brought about significant technological innovation, including the use of tanks, machine guns, aircraft, and chemical weapons. In addition, it saw the widespread use of trench warfare."}]
