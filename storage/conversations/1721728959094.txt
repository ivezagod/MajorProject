Some key concepts to understand include: the causes of the war (the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand, militarism, alliances, imperialism, and nationalism), the major powers involved (Allied vs. Central Powers), the role of technology (trench warfare, chemical weapons, tanks, airplanes), the impact on civilians, and the aftermath of the war (Treaty of Versailles, League of Nations).\n\n2. Real-world Relations and Other Fields of Study: WW1 had a profound impact on the world and shaped the 20th century.
