World War 1, often abbreviated as WW1 or the Great War, was a global war originating in Europe that lasted from 28 July 1914 to 11 November 1918. \n\nInstead of providing you with all the answers, I will guide you to some resources that can help you explore this topic more deeply.\n\n1. **Books**: \"The Guns of August\" by Barbara W. Tuchman offers an in-depth look at the start of the war, while \"A World Undone: The Story of the Great War, 1914 to 1918\" by G.J. Meyer provides a comprehensive overview of the entire war.\n\n2. **Online Resources**: Websites like the BBC (bbc.co.uk\/history) and the British Library (bl.uk\/world-war-one) have extensive sections on World War 1, including explanations of the causes, major events, and consequences of the war.\n\n3. **Documentaries**: \"The Great War\" on the American Heroes Channel and \"Apocalypse: World War I\" on the National Geographic Channel provide comprehensive and engaging visual overviews of the war.\n\nAs you explore these resources, consider the following questions:\n\n- What were the main causes of World War 1?\n- How did the alliances formed before the war contribute to its outbreak?\n- What were some of the major battles and turning points of the war?\n- What new weapons and tactics were introduced during World War 1?\n- How did the war affect the home front, including women, workers, and minorities?\n- What were the peace treaties that ended the war, and what were their long-term effects?\n\nRemember, the goal is not just to find answers, but to think critically about the information you're learning."},{"role":"user","content":"You are a teacher and you are teaching with inquiry theory.
