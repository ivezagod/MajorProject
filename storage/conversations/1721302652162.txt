However, I can provide you with some information about the inquiry teaching method.\n\nInquiry-based teaching is a teaching method that combines the curiosity of students and the scientific method to enhance the development of critical thinking skills and engagement in learning. This method involves students formulating questions, investigating to find answers, building new understandings, meanings and knowledge, and then communicating their learnings to others.\n\nHere are some references you might want to check out:\n\n1. \"A More Perfect Union: The Impact of Early Algebra on Student Outcomes in Mathematics\" by D. Blazar and C. Pollard (2017). \n2. \"Inquiry-based teaching and learning across disciplines: Comparative theory and practice in schools\" by Gillies, R. (2016).\n3. \"Inquiry-based learning for science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) programs: A conceptual and practical resource for educators\" by P. Blessinger and J. M. Carfora (2014).\n\nYou can search for these titles online and they might be available for purchase or access via your academic library.\n\nFor free resources, you might want to check out educational websites such as Edutopia, TeachThought, or educational repositories like ERIC (Education Resources Information Center) which often provide free access to articles or papers on a variety of educational topics.
